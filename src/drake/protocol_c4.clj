;; DESIGN TODO(aaron):
;; Error handling, skipping, backoff/retry, resume, log errors?
;;   Need to catch/rethrow with information about the line being processed,
;;     including the raw line
;; Consider flexible query syntax for things like limit, offsets,
;;     random-lines, etc.
;; Allow for rapid prototyping of c4 chunks of code. E.g.:
;;   (defn test-step [in-seq-or-file & c4-code)  ;; output is sent to stdout, or
;;     optional out seq for unit tests
;; Crosswalking, Resolving, etc., should be supported by a natural,
;;   fluid syntax that makes
;;   it intuitive to quickly code up a Crosswalk, Resolve, etc., via c4.
;;    Consider John saying,
;;   "Oh, you should Crosswalk that with the Open Table ID before falling
;;    back to a Resolve."
